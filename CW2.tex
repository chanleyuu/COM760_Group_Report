\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we will be looking at how widespread use of robotics may affect human civilization and what might be the best ways to implement robotics in society.

\section{Introduction}
As the field of robotics continues to develop, so will it's impact on the daily lives of people all over the world.
Robots are increasingly employed in almost every industry questions arise on the ethics of replacing humans in these roles. One primary concern is the loss of human employment, and how most people are supposed to earn a living with robots being in widespread use. Another concern would be the loss of human skills, after all, philosopher Ren√© Descartes famously said ``Cognito Ergo Sum'' ``I think therefore, I am''. If this is true, what happens if humans stop thinking? If what Descartes says is true, this has a grim implication for a civlisation which overuses automation.
